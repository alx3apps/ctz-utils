Various Java utility classes
============================

About utilities
---------------

This project contains various utilities, created when working with Spring Framework, Guava, PotgreSQL and others.

Note (__named-regexp__): classes form package ru.concerteza.util.namedregex were copied from here http://code.google.com/p/named-regexp/
without changes (only package name changed) because we weren't able to find them in public maven repo's at that time.
